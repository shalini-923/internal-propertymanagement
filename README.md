# Property Management System (PMS)

A Property Management System (PMS) built with Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF) to allow landlords, agents, and tenants to manage and view property listings. This project showcases REST API development, user role-based permissions, and advanced UI views (List, Grid, Map, Detail).

## Objective

The objective of this project is to provide a platform where:
- **Landlords/Agents** can manage properties (create, update, delete).
- **Tenants** can view property listings in various formats.
- The platform supports API-based property management and user authentication.

---

## Key Features

- **API Development**: REST APIs for CRUD operations on properties and user authentication.
- **Swagger Integration**: Auto-generated API documentation.
- **Views**: Implement List View, Grid View, Detail View, and Map View.
- **SQL Queries**: Custom SQL queries for filtering based on various property attributes.
- **Authentication**: User registration, login, and role-based permissions (landlord, agent, tenant).
- **JWT Authentication (Optional)**: For more secure, token-based authentication.
